# Meta Search for Komga

 Retriving metadata for Komga comics using AniList. The motivation behind this project is to match content with metadata in my Komga library that has been aquired from various DRM Free sources like Humble Bundle.

 This project was inspired by the [https://github.com/Pfuenzle/AnisearchKomga](AniSearchKomga) script.

 The goal is to pull data from aniList's Manga database.

 Each match should be given the option of correcting the match?


 ## Name parsing and matching

 Ideal folder/series naming should be something like: Name (Year) (Optional Notes), Name (year-year) (optional Notes)

 ## Further Plans

 I may look into saving the data into ComicInfo.xml files. Maybe.

 Per volume info may be retirved google books. WIll need to define how to recognise volume numbers (ex. toyoureternity_v11.cbz)
